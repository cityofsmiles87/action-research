### math achievement
Conclusion: Attitudes toward math (ATM) predict math achievement. Negative ATM are associated with avoidance of math content, while positive ATM are associated with exerting more effort on math tasks.  [@dem19]
Problem: This study investigated, for the first time, the effects of the interaction between math skill and ATM on the neurocognitive basis of arithmetic processing.
Participants: 9- to 12-year-old children
Method: 
Notes/comments: The results suggest that positive ATM in low-skill children might encourage them to more fully engage the neurocognitive systems underlying controlled effort and retrieval of multiplication facts. 
Weakness/recommendation: 

Conclusion: positive correlation between previous high achievement in mathematics and favorable attitude toward it.  [@kar17]

Conclusion: attitudes toward mathematics incrementally explaining 25% (Germany) and 7% (Belarus) of variance in mathematics grades over and above students' cognitive ability and Big Five personality dimensions.  [@lip16] 
Problem: investigated whether student-reported mathematics attitudes, conceptualized with the theory of planned behavior, incrementally contributed to students' mathematics grades over and above cognitive ability and the Big Five personality dimensions. 
Participants: College students from Germany (n = 179) and Belarus (n = 202) participated.
