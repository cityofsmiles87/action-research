### math achievement
Conclusion: Attitudes toward math (ATM) predict math achievement. Negative ATM are associated with avoidance of math content, while positive ATM are associated with exerting more effort on math tasks.  [@dem19]
Problem: This study investigated, for the first time, the effects of the interaction between math skill and ATM on the neurocognitive basis of arithmetic processing.
Participants: 9- to 12-year-old children
Method: 
Notes/comments: The results suggest that positive ATM in low-skill children might encourage them to more fully engage the neurocognitive systems underlying controlled effort and retrieval of multiplication facts. 
Weakness/recommendation: 

Conclusion: positive correlation between previous high achievement in mathematics and favorable attitude toward it.  [@kar17]

Conclusion: attitudes toward mathematics incrementally explaining 25% (Germany) and 7% (Belarus) of variance in mathematics grades over and above students' cognitive ability and Big Five personality dimensions.  [@lip16] 
Problem: investigated whether student-reported mathematics attitudes, conceptualized with the theory of planned behavior, incrementally contributed to students' mathematics grades over and above cognitive ability and the Big Five personality dimensions. 
Participants: College students from Germany (n = 179) and Belarus (n = 202) participated.

Conclusion: students with very positive or moderately positive levels of attitude performed better in comparison with students having negative attitudes toward mathematics, in all four stages of Polya’s problem-solving model, which includes understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. students with different degrees of positive and negative attitudes toward mathematics showed meaningful differences in choosing the strategies and being aware of evaluating their solutions.[@saa19] 
Problem: investigate whether students’ attitudes toward mathematics can affect their learning to solve non-routine mathematical problems through a collaborative learning approach.
