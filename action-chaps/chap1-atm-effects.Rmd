### math achievement
Conclusion: Attitudes toward math (ATM) predict math achievement. Negative ATM are associated with avoidance of math content, while positive ATM are associated with exerting more effort on math tasks.  [@dem19]
Problem: This study investigated, for the first time, the effects of the interaction between math skill and ATM on the neurocognitive basis of arithmetic processing.
Participants: 9- to 12-year-old children
Method: 
Notes/comments: The results suggest that positive ATM in low-skill children might encourage them to more fully engage the neurocognitive systems underlying controlled effort and retrieval of multiplication facts. 
Weakness/recommendation: 



Conclusion: attitudes toward mathematics incrementally explaining 25% (Germany) and 7% (Belarus) of variance in mathematics grades over and above students' cognitive ability and Big Five personality dimensions.  [@lip16] 
Problem: investigated whether student-reported mathematics attitudes, conceptualized with the theory of planned behavior, incrementally contributed to students' mathematics grades over and above cognitive ability and the Big Five personality dimensions. 
Participants: College students from Germany (n = 179) and Belarus (n = 202) participated.

Conclusion: students with very positive or moderately positive levels of attitude performed better in comparison with students having negative attitudes toward mathematics, in all four stages of Polya’s problem-solving model, which includes understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. students with different degrees of positive and negative attitudes toward mathematics showed meaningful differences in choosing the strategies and being aware of evaluating their solutions.[@saa19] 
Problem: investigate whether students’ attitudes toward mathematics can affect their learning to solve non-routine mathematical problems through a collaborative learning approach.

Conclusion: students’  attitudes  have  a  significant  relationship with  their  achievement  in  mathematics [@pet19] 
Problem: determined  the  attitudes  and  academic  achievement  of  students who  are  recipients  of  Conditional Cash  Transfer  (CCT)  towards  mathematics  in  a  public  national  high  school,  Bohol,  Philippines
Participants: 112  respondents
Method: descriptive  research, Pearson  r, Attitudes  toward  Mathematics  Inventory  (ATMI)

Conclusion: no  significant  relationship  of  attitudes  toward mathematics  with  mathematics  achievement [@jun19] 
Problem: to  determine  the  level  of  attitudes  toward mathematics,  mathematics  self-efficacy,  mathematics  achievement and  the relationship  among  them
Participants: 200  of  Grade  10  students  who enrolled  in  A  Len  Bum  IDPs  High  School  in  the  academic  year  2018-2019,   in  Kachin  State,  Myanmar
Method: Attitudes toward  mathematics  questionnaire  (ATMQ)  and  sources  of  mathematics  self-efficacy scale  (SMSES)

### self-efficacy
Conclusion:  strong and positive correlation was found between students’ attitudes and self-efficacy perceptions towards mathematics. [@mum15] 
Problem: determine the students’ attitudes and self-efficacy perceptions towards mathematics in terms of education programs, gender, grade level and mathematics performance, it also aims to see the relationship between attitudes and self-efficacy perceptions towards mathematics themselves.
Participants:  212 students from different departments in a multi- program high school. 
Method:  İndependent t-test, one way ANOVA and correlation, descriptive
