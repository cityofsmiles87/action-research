''And while it was initially an expression of sentimentality, sorrow or spite, hugot eventually took on playful undertones as usage became more and more widespread... ''[@ver18].

``Math Hugot'' is a statement creatively relating a Mathematical concept to  human relationships so as to invoke sentimental memories or humor.

Defining Characteristics of a ``Math Hugot''

1. Relates, not applies, a Math concept to human relationships. 
2. The relating is done creatively by: 
     a. exploiting the ambiguity of Mathematical terms. 
Example: "Sana naging 90-degree angle na lang ako. Bakit? Para masabi mong ako na si Mr. Right.''
     b. relating the Math concept to an aspect of human life that is not obviously related to Math, that is, relationships 
Example: "Ang love story natin ay parang asymptotes, kasi  kahit anong lapit ko sa iyo, di pa rin tayo magtatagpo.''
     c. applying the figures of speech, usually simile or metaphor 
Example: "Sana naging center ka na lang at circumference naman ako. Bakit? Para sa iyo umikot ang buhay ko.''
3. Elicits humor or nostalgic emotions. 
4. Can be a one-line statement or in the form of a "pick-up line''.
