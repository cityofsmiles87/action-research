Now that you have an idea (from  your  literature review) how broad  your topic could be,  tell the reader what it  is that you  are deliberately  not  going to study.  What  aspects of the problem  are outside your interests at this point (or for this paper)?  Then, if you had 3 years and 1,000,000 what are some  of the things you could or would improve about your design, sample, analysis, etc.

The main focus of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using "Math Hugot"  in improving attitudes toward  Mathematics among  Grade 10 students  of Sauyo High School, 2nd Laguna St., NIA Village, Sauyo, Quezon City, Metro Manila. Therefore, the results of this study may not be applicable to students in lower or higher grades.   
 

The lessons to be discussed during the intervention period are taken from Module 2 of the book Mathematics -- Grade 10 
Learnerâ€™s Module by cal15. Module 2 discusses Polynomials and Polynomial Equations and includes the following lessons: 
Division of Polynomials, The Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem, and Polynomial Equations. To cover these lessons, the intervention will last for the whole month of July  during  the first grading period of the school year 2019--2020. 



Two sections from Grade 10 will be included as respondents, with approximately 45 students per section.
