The following factors have an impact on attitudes toward Mathematics: 

### gender 
Conclusion: there was a significant main effect of gender on mean attitude scores. males’ average attitude score was significantly less than females’ average attitude scores.  school type did not have signifi-cant main effect on mean self-efficacy scores, anxiety scores, and achieve-ment scores but have significant effect on attitude scores. the attitude scores of private school stu-dents were significantly higher than the mean attitude scores of public school students. [@rec18] 
Problem: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among seventh grade students’ mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anx-iety, attitudes towards mathematics, mathematics achievement, gender and school type.
Participants: 934 seventh grade students with an average age of 12 from 13 elementary schools, seven public and six private, in Ankara, Turkey
Method: two-way ANO-VAs, multiple regression analysis,  Two associational research types, causal-comparative and correlational research designs 
Notes/comments: good pattern for results reporting 
Weakness/recommendation: done in elementary, respondents sampled convenience

Conclusion: there was  a statistical significant  difference for gender in both constructs of the questionnaire, with female  students scoring higher than  male students in both constructs (enjoyment of mathematics and mathematical self-perceptions [@afa18]

Conclusion: Longitudinally, higher mathematical competence in sixth grade was associated with lower mathematics anxiety for evaluations and better mathematics attitudes in seventh grade for girls but not for boys. The key finding is that adolescent girls’ mathematics anxiety and their attitudes toward mathematics are more reflective of their actual mathematical competence than they are for boys.  [@gea19] 
Problem: Sex differences in the strength of the relations between mathematics anxiety, mathematics attitudes, and mathematics achievement were assessed concurrently in sixth grade and longitudinally from sixth to seventh grade 
Participants: sixth grade (n = 1,091, 545 boys) and sixth to seventh grade (n = 190, 97 boys)
Method: 
Notes/comments: One implication is that relative to boys with low mathematics achievement, girls with low achievement are at higher risk of developing mathematics anxiety and poor attitudes toward mathematics
Weakness/recommendation: 

Conclusion: As far as their genders are concerned, there are no differences between male and female students attitude toward mathematics.  [@sir19]

### parental influences,  teacher  affective  support and  classroom  instruction
Conclusion: Students’  attitude  towards  mathematics  is  affected by  factors  such  as  parental influences,  teacher  affective  support and  classroom  instruction. Teacher  affective  support and classroom  instruction  predict  attitude  towards  mathematics  more  than  parental influences.  [@dav18]

Conclusion: Higher prior mathematics achievement and positive parental beliefs and attitudes were significant predictors of higher scores across the 3 indicators. At the classroom level, classroom assessment was significantly associated with less endorsement of all 3 indicators, higher levels of classroom modeling with greater endorsement of perceived usefulness of mathematics, and classroom questioning with greater enjoyment of mathematics. [@kiw17] 
Problem: investigated the effects of student and classroom characteristics on math self-confidence, perceived usefulness, and enjoyment of mathematics as multiple outcomes.

Conclusion: adolescents  who perceived that their parents liked  mathematics and considered mathematics was  important for their children not only  to study but  also  for  their  career tended to  report higher levels  of intrinsic and instrumental motivation to learn mathematics, mathematics  self-concept and self-efficacy, and mathematics  work ethic [@are15] 
Problem: examined the relations of adolescent children's perceptions  of their parents' attitudes towards mathematics to their own attitudes  towards mathematics  and mathematics  achievement

### Anxiety 
Conclusion: elementary students had higher level of attitude towards mathematics in comparison to their mathematics anxiety level. Findings of the study revealed that mathematics attitudes were linked to their mathematics anxiety. Although the magnitude of the correlations between mathematics anxiety and attitude towards mathematics were not very strong, the significant relationship between these two components should be acknowledged.

Conclusion: intrinsic, home environment and teacher factors have positive direct effects on the students' attitudes toward mathematics with intrinsic factor having the strongest and the most significant effect on students' attitudes toward mathematics. The findings also revealed that peer group factor and school environment factor have negative effects on students' attitudes toward mathematics [@oye17] 
Problem: use path analysis to investigate the type of direct effects the motivational factors have on the students' attitudes toward mathematics.

Conclusion: the extreme response style explains a significant amount of variances in the students’attitude toward mathematics. Additionally, students with a negative attitude toward mathematics were found to have an extreme response style. It was concluded that an extreme response style had an effect on students’ attitude [@dib19]

### Number Type
Conclusion: children and adults have different attitudes about mathematics when asked specifically about whole numbers, as opposed to fractions. The vast majority of children and adults reported negative attitudes toward fractions despite having positive attitudes toward whole numbers. Across both children and adults, the difference in fraction and whole-number attitudes was present across levels of math achievement, indicating that it was not just participants who were worse at math whose attitudes differed by number type.
