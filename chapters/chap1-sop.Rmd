The main goal of this study is to determine whether the application of ``Math Hugot"   improves the Grade 10 students' attitudes toward  Mathematics.  Specifically, this study aims to answer the following questions: 

1. What is the attitude  toward  Mathematics of the control group and experimental group as measured by the Attitudes toward Mathematics Inventory (ATMI) during the following periods: 
   a. before using "Math Hugot"? 
   b. after  using "Math Hugot"? 

2. How is the usage and creation of ``Math Hugot" applied as an intervention for improving   the attitudes of the respondents toward  Mathematics? 

3. What is the attitude  of the Grade 10 students toward  Mathematics after  using "Math Hugot" as measured by the ATMI? 

4. Is there a significant difference in the pre-intervention and post-intervention ATMI scores of the: 
   a. control group? 
   b. experimental group? 

5. Is there a significant difference in the post-intervention ATMI scores of the control group and the experimental group? 

6. Is there a significant difference in the post-intervention ATMI scores of the male and female respondents in the experimental group?

7. How can the usage and creation of ``Math Hugot"  be better implemented so as to achieve greater improvement  in  attitudes toward  Mathematics?
