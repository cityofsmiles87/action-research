This study offers significant insights about the feasibility  of using "Math Hugot" in improving attitudes toward  Mathematics among Grade 10 students. These insights may be deemed significant by the following stakeholders of education: 


For the *teachers*, the results of this study may help them incorporate the use of ``Math Hugot" in teaching so as to improve the students' attitudes toward Mathematics. 

For the *students*, the creation of "Math Hugot"  may help them make Mathematics  more relatable  and concrete, which can improve their attitudes toward the subject. This improvement may encourage them to choose Math-related careers in the future. 

For the *parents*,  the results of this study may help them better understand the role of attitudes toward Mathematics   in guiding  their children’s decision in choosing their future careers. These findings can also encourage them to actively participate in improving  their children’s attitudes  by serving as role models.


For the *school administrators*,  the outcomes of this research may  be used as  basis for better classroom practices, lesson planning, and further teacher trainings in order to improve student attitudes toward Mathematics.


For the *curriculum planners*, the use of "Math Hugot" in improving attitudes toward Mathematics may help align the curriculum to the industry's need   for more female professionals performing  Math-related careers. 


For *future researchers*, the results of this study may inspire them to further the teaching discipline by exploring novel ways of incorporating "Math Hugot" in  the teaching-learning process.
