After acquiring the necessary permits and determining the two sections that will serve as the respondents of this study, the researcher will teach both the control group and the experimental group using direct instruction while incorporating "Math Hugot"  in teaching the experimental group. The pretest results will be used to determine the two sections.


 During the intervention period, the researcher will present  a "Math Hugot" before giving the seatwork for each lesson. The presentation involves 
1. reading aloud the "Math Hugot" posted on the board, 
2. asking the students to identify the Mathematics concept and the human experience being compared, and
3. prompting the learners to determine other  Mathematics concepts discussed in the lesson which they may use to create their own "Math Hugot". 


After answering the seatwork, the students will be asked to make  their own "Math Hugot" in a 1/4 sheet of paper  which will be submitted the following school day. The researcher will then collect the papers and rate each "Math Hugot" using a rubric. The scores will be recorded  as  points for recitation. 


 At the end of the intervention period, the post-test will be given to both groups and the scores will be tallied for data analysis.
