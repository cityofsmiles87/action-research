The main focus of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using ``Math Hugot"  in improving attitudes toward  Mathematics among  Grade 10 students  of Sauyo High School, 2nd Laguna St., NIA Village, Sauyo, Quezon City, Metro Manila. Therefore, the results of this study may not be applicable to students in lower or higher grades.   
 

The lessons to be discussed during the intervention period are taken from Module 2 of the book Mathematics -- Grade 10 
Learnerâ€™s Module by [@cal15]. Module 2 discusses Polynomials and Polynomial Equations and includes the following lessons: 
Division of Polynomials, The Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem, and Polynomial Equations. To cover these lessons, the intervention will last for the whole month of July  during  the first grading period of the school year 2019--2020. 



Two sections from Grade 10 will be included as respondents, with approximately 45 students per section.
