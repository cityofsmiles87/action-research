This study is a quantitative, quasi-experimental research utilizing the two-group pretest-posttest design. The independent variable is the application of "Math Hugot" in teaching Mathematics which also serves as the intervention. The dependent variable is the attitudes toward  Mathematics  of the Grade 10 students of Sauyo High School.  By determining whether a significant difference exists in the pre-intervention and post-intervention scores of the respondents in Attitudes toward Mathematics Inventory (ATMI), the researcher will be able to establish the effectiveness of "Math Hugot"  on improving student attitudes toward  Mathematics.
